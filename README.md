# PyTorch_101


We have to design the following neural network 

1> Neural Network Architecture

   take 2 inputs:
 
     an image from the MNIST dataset (say 5), and
     a random number between 0 and 9, (say 7)
   
   and gives two outputs:
 
    the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image (predict 5), and
    the "sum" of this number with the random number and the input image to the network (predict 5 + 7 = 12)

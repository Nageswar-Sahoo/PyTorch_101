# PyTorch_101


We have to design the following neural network 

1> Neural Network Architecture

 take 2 inputs:
 
    an image from the MNIST dataset (say 5), and
   a random number between 0 and 9, (say 7)
 and gives two outputs:
 
  the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image (predict 5), and
  the "sum" of this number with the random number and the input image to the network (predict 5 + 7 = 12)
